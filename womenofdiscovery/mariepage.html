				    			Maria Sklodowska, later known as Marie Curie, was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw (modern-day Poland). As a child, Curie took after her father. She had a bright and curious mind and excelled at school. Curie completed her master’s degree in physics in 1893 and earned another degree in mathematics the following year.

    			Her contribution to physics had been immense. Marie Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person — man or woman — to win the award twice. The famed scientist died in 1934 of aplastic anemia likely caused by exposure to radiation. </p>

    				Curie discovered radioactivity, and, together with her husband Pierre, the radioactive elements polonium and radium while working with the mineral pitchblende. She also championed the development of X-rays after Pierre’s death.
