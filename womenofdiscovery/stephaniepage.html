				    			Born in New Kensington, PA, Kwolek developed a love of fabrics and sewing from her mother, a homemaker. She also had a strong interest in teaching, chemistry, and especially medicine. After graduating from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College in 1946 with a degree in chemistry, Kwolek applied for a position as a chemist with the DuPont Company.

Today, Kevlar® is used in hundreds of products, including bulletproof vests, spacecrafts, helmets, tennis racquets, tires, and protective gloves.</p>

    			In a new and fast-growing field of synthetic fibers, Kwolek never left employment with DuPont. She moved with the company’s Pioneering Research Laboratory to Wilmington, Delaware, and retired with the rank of research associate in 1986. Having accumulated many patents and awards in her career, she continued in retirement to work as a consultant and public speaker. </p>

    				In 1965, Stephanie Kwolek made an unexpected discovery that led to the creation of synthetic fibers so strong, not even steel bullets could penetrate them. During her analysis of long molecule chains at low temperatures, Kwolek observed how polyamide molecules line up to form liquid crystalline polymer solutions of exceptional strength and stiffness. That discovery made way for Kwolek’s invention of industrial fibers that today protect and save thousands of lives.
